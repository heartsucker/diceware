# diceware

An improvement on the original `diceware` list, originally published by A G Reinhold. This list attempts to remove hard to memorize random letter combinations, words that may be unfamiliar even to native speakers, and words with uncommon spellings.

## Usage

Instructions on how to use diceware passphrases can be found [here](http://world.std.com/~reinhold/diceware.html).

## In the Wild

This list was used by [SecureDrop](https://securedrop.org) and was introduced via
[this commit](https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop/commit/ff87f9a01feece5574ac2363919778b30efc2f65).
It is also used by the [Python diceware CLI](https://github.com/ulif/diceware).

## diff
For the curious, the full diff from the original list can be shown using:

```bash
diff wordlists/en_US/wordlist.txt <(wget -q http://world.std.com/~reinhold/diceware.wordlist.asc -O - | tail -n +3 | head -7776 | awk '{ print $NF }' | sort)
```

## Hacking

Set up the dev environment with `setup.sh`.

Run all the dev tasks with `cli.py`.
